# Rossmann Store Sales Forecast

Data Science project consisting of forecasting the sales of +1,000 drug stores from a dataset published @ [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) 

Its management follows the [CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) methodology, aiming to work in the problem through successively deeper cycles, while delivering value early, since the first run.  

## Status

ML modeling pipeline is complete, with the model already at production, furnishing predictions through a Telegram bot. The deployment scripts are included in the last section of the .ipynb file.

Final polishing of the notebook and organization of the repository are currently being carried out, with the proper documentation also being done.

## Next steps 
	
After the final touches on the notebook and in the structure of this repository, this README will be updated with a very informative report on the project.
