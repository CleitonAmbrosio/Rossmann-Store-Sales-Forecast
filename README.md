## Business Problem
Rossmann is one of the largest chains of drugstores in Europe, with +50k employees and +4k stores as of 2019 <sup>[1]</sup>. Its business model is that of a common pharmacy - selling products with occasional promotions -, but with several standardized units spread throughout the continent.

The manager of each store comes up with the task of predicting the daily sales of their units for up to six weeks in advance. This task is assigned to the Data Science team of the whole chain, who must model the historical database in order to generate the desired forecasting. 

The database spans around 2.5 years in time (between 2013 and 2015) and 1115 stores in total, containing information for each unit describing promotions, competition, school and state holidays and seasonality.
