# Rossmann Store Sales Forecast

Data Science project consisting of forecasting the sales of +1,000 drug stores from a dataset published @ [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) 

Its management follows the [CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) methodology, aiming to work in the problem through successively deeper cycles, while delivering value early, since the first run.  

## Status

ML modeling pipeline is complete, with the model already at production, furnishing predictions through a Telegram bot. The deployment scripts are included in the last section of the .ipynb file.

Organization of the repository are currently being carried out, as well as the writing of a proper README.

## Next steps 
	
In the next few days, this README shall be updated with a very informative report on the project.
