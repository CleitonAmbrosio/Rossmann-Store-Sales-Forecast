# Rossmann Store Sales Forecast

This is my 1st Data Science project, still in development. It consists of forecasting the sales of +1,000 drug stores from a dataset published @ [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) 

Its management follows the [CRISP-DM](https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/) methodology, aiming to work in the problem through successively deeper cycles, while delivering value early, since the first run.  

## Status

I am currently working on the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), seeking to verify the hypotheses arised previously.

Data has already been properly cleaned and some features have been engineered based on a list of hypotheses derived from the following mind map.

## Next steps 
	
After finishing the EDA, the data will be prepared for modelling.
